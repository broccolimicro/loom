Welcome to Loom's documentation!

Loom is an end to end circuit design toolset, including synthesis, simulation,
verification, and visualization. Loom compiles your functional specification
directly to layout. The compilation algorithms produce results that are correct
by construction. Furthermore, Loom synthesizes Quasi-Delay Insensitive
circuits. This is a circuit family that makes the fewest possible timing
assumptions. In the end this allows people to design circuits using standard
programming language constructs then compile them straight to layout without
worrying about functional or timing verification.
